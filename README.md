### Hi there 👋

Hi! I’m **Dheeraj**, a software engineer who loves turning ideas into delightful, scalable products.  
I craft end-to-end solutions from crisp front-ends to back-end services using **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, and an ever growing toolkit of modern frameworks.

- 🌎  Based in Texas, USA  
- 🛠  Day-to-day stack: ** React · Vue.js · Node.js · Python · Flask · Express · MongoDB · PostgreSQL **  
- ☁️  Cloud playgrounds: **AWS · Azure · Vercel · Cloudflare Workers **  
- 📱  Mobile: **Native Android** (Kotlin and Java) & **React Native (IOS & Android)**  
- 💡  Always learning about AI engineering : model deployment, RAG and best practices

I’m also actively looking to **collaborate on open-source projects** especially those improving developer workflows or accessibility.

## 🎨 Design & Prototyping
- Skilled in **Figma** for quick, interactive mock-ups.  
- Map user flows & wireframes before code starts.  
- Iterate visuals fast for stakeholder feedback.  
- Keep dev hand-off smooth with clear specs.
